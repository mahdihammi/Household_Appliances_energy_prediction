# Household Appliances Energy Consumption Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the energy consumption of household appliances. Accurate predictions of energy consumption can help in optimizing energy usage and planning for energy needs. This project involves understanding the dataset, performing data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA), conducting hypothesis testing, selecting relevant features, and building predictive models.
## Understanding Variables

## Data Wrangling 
Data wrangling involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis <br>

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps in understanding the distribution and relationships between variables. <br>

## Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis is used to identify relationships between variables. Key steps include:
Calculating the correlation matrix. <br>
Visualizing the correlation matrix using a heatmap. <br>
Identifying highly correlated variables for feature selection or engineering. <br>

## Outliers Detection and Removal
Outliers can significantly impact model performance. Key steps include:<br>
Identifying outliers using statistical method IQR.<br>
Visualizing outliers using box plots.<br>
Removing or treating outliers appropriately.<br>

## Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing helps in understanding the significance of relationships between variables. Key steps include: <br>
Formulating null and alternative hypotheses. <br>
Interpreting p-values to accept or reject hypotheses. <br>

## Feature Selection Using VIF Test
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) helps in identifying multicollinearity among features. Key steps include: <br>
Calculating VIF for each feature. <br>
Removing features with high VIF values to reduce multicollinearity. <br>
Selecting the most relevant features for modeling. <br>

## Modeling
The final step involves building and evaluating predictive models. Key steps include: <br>
Splitting the data into training and testing sets. <br>
Building various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree). <br>
Evaluating model performance using metrics such as MAE, and R^2. <br>
Fine-tuning model hyperparameters for optimal performance. <br>
Comparing model performances and selecting the best model. <br>
